ok I am not a total newbie to computers and coiding havings started in 1975.
However I am more or less new to linux and HA.
I would guess I am a typical person wanting to set up z2m, having done a bit in HA and found its limitations.
I have also prepared manuals and know how hard it it to hit the right level, even if you know the level because one  takes too much for granted.
Users may not need to do a configuration again so make it super simple. If you want more generality its fine, but new people will not know the purpose of the headings in /config/zigbee2mqtt and what needs to be in there and how it should be formatted.
So, given that you recommend Mosquito lets have a knock-by-knock description on how to do it.
So, where to find "user" which "password" [the system may have several] exactly what yo copy and past in and what needs to be specific to the installation.
By following it and filling in the specifics we new people can learn because its surprising how many things are "obvious" to the skilled user but not at all to the novice.
Please do not say novices should not be dabbling in this, that's how they (and I'll bet - you) learn.

Many thanks.
